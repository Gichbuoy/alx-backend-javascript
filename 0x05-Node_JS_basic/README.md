## Node,js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside a web browser. It's built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, the same engine that powers Google Chrome. 
- Node.js enables the execution of server-side JavaScript, making it possible to build scalable and high-performance network applications.
